The F\+L\+O\+R\+IS model is being used to make online predictions about the best locations in a windfarm to take measurements. From this, U\+AV trajectories will be generated. The files included in this documentation have been created (or altered from the Floris source code) in order to carry out this research.

\mbox{\hyperlink{visualization__manager___d_j_8py}{visualization\+\_\+manager\+\_\+\+D\+J.\+py}}

This package contains functions which handle visualizations of Floris data.

\mbox{\hyperlink{_animate_error_8py}{Animate\+Error.\+py}}

This is a test script which runs the animate\+Dn\+Serror function from \mbox{\hyperlink{visualization__manager___d_j_8py}{visualization\+\_\+manager\+\_\+\+D\+J.\+py}}

\mbox{\hyperlink{_plot_sensitivity_matrix_8py}{Plot\+Sensitivity\+Matrix.\+py}}

This is a test script which runs the plot\+Sensitivity\+Matrix function from \mbox{\hyperlink{visualization__manager___d_j_8py}{visualization\+\_\+manager\+\_\+\+D\+J.\+py}}

\mbox{\hyperlink{_reduced_s_m_8py}{Reduced\+S\+M.\+py}}

This is a script which runs the reduced\+SM function from \mbox{\hyperlink{visualization__manager___d_j_8py}{visualization\+\_\+manager\+\_\+\+D\+J.\+py}}

\mbox{\hyperlink{example__input_8json}{example\+\_\+input.\+json}}

This is an example J\+S\+ON object which is used as the input parameters to create a Floris windfarm simulation.

\mbox{\hyperlink{input__reader_8py}{input\+\_\+reader.\+py}}

This file was altered from the original to allow a Floris object to be created from a J\+S\+ON object rather than just a file.
